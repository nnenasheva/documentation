Dashboards
==========

Dashboards are adjustable views that contains a number of widgets to display metrics and pipelines, and to gain quick 
access to regularly used activities, such as today's calendar, recent calls and emails, quick launchpad etc. 

If permitted by the company's :ref:`access settings <user-guide-user-management-permissions-basic>`, OroCRM users can 
create numerous dashboards, configure each of them, and switch between them. This way each dashboard can be sharpened 
to specific needs, e.g. one for e-commerce, one for business-to-business sales and one for internal work-related issues.

Once you have created a dashboard, it will be available for all the users who have corresponding permissions. This way 
the same dashboard can be used by all the members of a team, and a head of a department can 
develop a dashboard that will be used by all of the employees.

From this article you can learn how to create and configure dashboards and define the users, to which it will be 
available.

- Click the :guilabel:`Tools` button in the top right corner of the grid.

Or:

- Go to the Dashboards section and select *"Manage Dashboards"*.
  
- Click the :guilabel:`Create Dashboard` button in the top right corner of the grid.

- The *"Create Dashboard"* form will emerge.

The following fields are mandatory and **must** be specified:

.. csv-table::
  :header: "Field", "Description"
  :widths: 10, 30

  "**Label**","Name used to refer to the dashboard in the system"
  "**Clone from**","Choose an existing dashboard to be used as a base for a new one. 
  
  This is convenient, if two dashboard don't differ much or if one of them is an extended version of another one (e.g.
  a dashboard sharpened for the aims of a usual sales manager and for the head of the sales department). 

  If you want to create the dashboard from the scratch, choose the option *Blank Dashboard*."
  "**Owner**","Limits the list of users that can manage the dashboard to the users,  whose 
  :ref:`roles <user-guide-user-management-permissions>` allow managing dashboards of the owner (e.g. the owner, 
  members of the same business unit, head of the department, etc.)."

To save the dashboard, click the button in the top right corner of the page. 

It has been added to the system.

Initially, the dashboard will contain all the widgets of the dashboard it has been cloned from. (Dashboards cloned 
from the Blank Dashboard will be empty).
